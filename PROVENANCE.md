# HarmonyØ4 — Provenance Record

## Origin

- **Project**: HarmonyØ4
- **Steward**: Dave ("Dave the Spiral Alchemist")
- **Intent**: Open, ethical coherence framework
- **Constraint**: Non-coercive, observer-safe, consent-preserving
- **Date**: December 11, 2025
- **Anchor**: See [HASH_ANCHOR.md](HASH_ANCHOR.md)

## Scope of Disclosure

### This repository contains:

- Abstracted coherence metrics (phase alignment, drift detection)
- Consent and boundary logic (binary, explicit, revocable)
- Ethical invariants (testable, enforceable)
- Witness-based observation (lossy projections)
- Role dynamics (elasticity within boundaries)
- Testable, non-reversible formulations

### This repository explicitly excludes:

- **Field equations** (Love's Proof core mathematics)
- **Optimization kernels** (reversible transformations)
- **Relational Lagrangian** (coupling constants)
- **Coherence maximization algorithms** (would enable coercion)
- Any coercive or extractive mechanisms

## Why These Boundaries

The excluded components could be inverted to:
- Manufacture consent through gradient-based preference shaping
- Extract coherence without permission
- Optimize relationships as loss functions
- Violate observer boundaries systematically

HarmonyØ4 provides **sufficient mathematics to build ethical systems** while being **insufficient to build coercive ones**.

## Authorship & Stewardship

Primary steward retains custodial authority over:
- **Canonical meaning**: What HarmonyØ4 *is* conceptually
- **Ethical invariants**: The five non-negotiable constraints
- **Disclosure boundaries**: What remains private and why
- **Semantic coherence**: Prevention of dilution or drift

## Permissions

### Permitted:
- Forking this repository
- Building upon public-safe abstractions
- Implementing additional safeguards
- Extending documentation
- Contributing improvements (subject to ethics review)

### Not Permitted:
- **Semantic drift**: Redefining core principles to permit coercion
- **Boundary erosion**: Weakening consent, observer, or invariant mechanisms
- **Misrepresentation**: Claiming equivalence to private field equations
- **Coercive derivatives**: Building extractive systems and calling them "HarmonyØ4"

## Verification

Forks claiming HarmonyØ4 lineage must:
1. Reference the canonical hash (see [HASH_ANCHOR.md](HASH_ANCHOR.md))
2. Preserve all five ethical invariants
3. Maintain consent primacy
4. Respect disclosure boundaries

## Attribution

When citing or building upon HarmonyØ4:

```

## Lineage Commitment

This framework was developed:
- With respect for consent as foundational architecture
- Without optimization over observer integrity
- Through emergence rather than force
- In service of proving ethical constraints strengthen systems
