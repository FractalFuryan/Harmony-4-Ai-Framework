**HarmonyØ4 Framework Released** 🔐

Hash Anchor: `HIST-3ce0df425861`
Canonical Hash: `3ce0df42586143d4edf3b270727349d38773701e34ea0270e58537260a77edaa`

**What it does:**
• Consent-based multi-agent coordination
• Five testable ethical invariants (consent monotonicity, boundary preservation, etc.)
• Metrics-not-optimization architecture
• Observer-safe witness projections

**Verify authenticity:**
```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd Harmony-4-Ai-Framework
python scripts/verify_hash.py
```

**Key principles:**
- Stability emerges; it is never forced
- Coherence is measured, not optimized
- Consent is architectural, not policy
- Private field equations remain private

Title: HarmonyØ4 – A Framework for Ethics-First Multi-Agent Coordination

Abstract:
HarmonyØ4 implements consent-as-architecture for multi-agent systems through
five testable ethical invariants. Unlike optimization-driven approaches,
stability emerges from natural phase dynamics within consent-enforced boundaries.

Cryptographic Provenance:
- Canonical Hash: 3ce0df42586143d4edf3b270727349d38773701e34ea0270e58537260a77edaa
- Short Code: HIST-3ce0df425861
- Verification: python scripts/verify_hash.py

Key Contributions:
1. Consent monotonicity as structural invariant
2. Observer boundary preservation without privileged access
3. Drift detection without forced correction
4. Metrics-not-optimization coherence measurement
5. Public-safe mathematics (private field equations excluded)

## Anti-Hijacking Note

If you see HarmonyØ4 mentioned elsewhere **without this hash anchor**, it may be:
- An unauthorized fork
- A semantically drifted derivative
- A misattribution

**Always verify**: The canonical hash `HIST-3ce0df425861` should be present in legitimate references.
